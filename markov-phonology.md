I find it fascinating to listen to videos like (this) one and (this) one, in which people speak a language that sounds very much like english.  What the creators of these videos are doing, is stringing together chains of sounds according to the same rules that English words follow.  I decided to make a ?Markov Model? of these rules, and then generate new ‘words’ that follow these rules.  I guessed that most of the most likely combinations of sounds from English would already be English words, and I was very curious to see what would be the most English-sounding word that wasn’t actually an English word.

So what do I mean by the “rules” that English words follow?
